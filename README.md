# Simon-Game
The Simon Game is a classic memory skill game where players are challenged to remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that become increasingly difficult as the game progresses. Each round, the game randomly highlights one of four colored buttons with an accompanying effect, and the player must repeat the sequence in the correct order.
